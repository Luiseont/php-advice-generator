# PHP Advice Generator

This is the PHP Advice generator. It will generate a random advice and advice number considered as the "ID" of the Advice.
The main goal is using PHP to fetch data from an API and display it in the HTML, also after a clicking event it'll change the advice using front-end JavaScript (AJAX).
